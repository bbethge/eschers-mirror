Translation
-----------
I hope to support internationalization eventually.  Since I wanted to do a
special effect for the title screen, the title is not just a string that has
to be translated, but hand-drawn text in an SVG file.  Until I write a more
powerful SVG parser, the format of this file has several constraints on it:
 * Each letter should be a single path object.
 * Everything is contained in a group object.  (Inkscape does this implicitly,
   so you don't have to explicitly group the letters.)
 * All the paths consist of straight lines (this is partly a stylistic
   constraint).
 * The path data must use only the commands m, l, and z (as of 0.47 Inkscape
   does this automatically if all the segments are straight).  There must be
   a command explicitly given for each pair of coordinates (in Inkscape
   preferences, under "SVG Output", under "Path data", check "Force repeat
   commands".
 * It may be necessary to use absolute coordinates (in Inkscape preferences,
   under "SVG Output", under "Path data", uncheck "Allow relative coordinates").
 * In Inkscape, it will be necessary to save as plain SVG for the above settings
   to take effect.
 * There must be no transformations applied to anything.  To accomplish this in
   Inkscape, open the XML editor, select the layer group that contains the
   letters, and delete its transform attribute if it has one.  Then deselect
   everything, then select everything, then group.  Align this group to the top
   left corner of the page, then ungroup.  Now you can select "Fit page to
   selection" in document properties.
 * The scale of the drawing is insignificant, but the page should fit the logo.
 * The color of the letters is insignificant, but it will be easier to edit if
   adjacent letters are in different colors.

Stylistic guidelines:
 * The letters should be fairly fat, but it may be necessary to vary the weight
   to make it look good.
 * There should be as few gaps between letters as possible.  Take every
   opportunity to make letters fit together.
 * Use right angles as much as possible.
